The total market capitalization for stablecoins have multiplied by an eye-watering 370x over the past year to hit USD$190 billion, accounting for close to 9% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. This meteoric rise underscores the pent-up demand from crypto-natives for on-chain store of value; seen as crypto safe harbors to shield their assets from the volatility of the general market. <br/>
The maturing stablecoin landscape has also created new opportunities for real world integrations, as crypto-natives (identified as a transnational group of like-minded people who prefer to have their assets on-chain than to rely on TradFi institutions) seek ways to pay for goods and services on chain.

As digital currencies becomes more widely accepted, we will potentially see an increase in the number of crypto-natives. Crypto-natives typically have a large portion of their assets in cryptocurrencies, eschewing credit cards in favor of crypto wallets. As a result, they are looking for ways to spend while remaining on-chain, minimizing their footprint outside of the blockchain. Many companies have woken up to the existence of this new consumer group, and have been testing payments through various cryptocurrencies.
